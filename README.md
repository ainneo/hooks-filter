## Description

This project is a hooks form with useRef and forwardRef hooks, and onChange handlers. Here I created a resuable Input component and used useRef to focus on an input (at pg refresh or load), on input enter - move to the next input, and tab to the next input. Then I used forwardRef in the Input component to fordward refs, so that the refs are forwarded to every Input component used.
